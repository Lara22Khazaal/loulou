            <h3>chemistry</h3>
             <p>
                Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.
                It is a natural science that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, 
                molecules and ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with other substances.
                Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.
                In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology
                It is sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.
                For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).

            <h3>physics</h3>
            <p>
                Physics is the basic physical science. Until rather recent times physics and natural philosophy were used interchangeably for the science whose aim is the discovery and formulation of the fundamental laws of nature. 
                As the modern sciences developed and became increasingly specialized, physics came to denote that part of physical science not included in astronomy, chemistry, geology, and engineering. Physics plays an important role in all the natural sciences, however, 
                and all such fields have branches in which physical laws and measurements receive special emphasis, bearing such names as astrophysics, geophysics, biophysics, and even psychophysics. Physics can, at base, be defined as the science of matter, motion, and energy. 
                Its laws are typically expressed with economy and precision in the language of mathematics.
                Both experiment, the observation of phenomena under conditions that are controlled as precisely as possible, and theory,
                 the formulation of a unified conceptual framework, play essential and complementary roles in the advancement of physics. 
                 Physical experiments result in measurements, which are compared with the outcome predicted by theory. A theory that reliably predicts the results of experiments to which it is applicable is said to embody a law of physics. 
                 However, a law is always subject to modification, replacement, or restriction to a more limited domain, if a later experiment makes it necessary.

            <h3>mathematics</h3>
            <p>
                Maths is a fun subject. But learning Maths has never been easy. 
                At BYJU’S, you can create such a strong foundation in this subject, with the help of which any mathematical problems would seem to be a cakewalk to you. Getting a good grip in Math fundamentals, through understanding and practice, will tend to develop your brain in a logical way and help you to grasp the concepts in all other subjects with greater speed and efficiency.
                We are providing learning materials for students of Class 6 to 12 based on the syllabus. 
                In these classes, students set their foot into the world of all the important theories in Maths, like whole numbers,basic geometry, integers, decimals, algebra, ratio and proportion, etc. 
                Since kids are more receptive to learning, when it is associated more with play than with work, hence it is a good idea for parents to expose kids to math in fun ways. 
                We provide lessons for students till class 12, where they study the most complex topics like 3-D geometry, vector algebra, differential equations, matrices, etc. 
                A few of the links of important topics have been shared here for your convenience.
                With the help of animations and innovative ways of teaching by our experts, the ideas and concepts are sure to stay etched in your minds forever.  
                The purpose is to make math fun and help kids grow to understand that math is fun. Instead of being afraid, the kids will then be excited about the subject for the rest of their educational journey.
                You can engage yourself with interactive video sessions, regular tests prepared by our experts and do continuous analysis based on your performance.
                The interactive video lessons on BYJU’S learning app will give you very elaborate and detailed explanations of the various ideas in Maths.
